                    \          Dieses Kapitel sind ausschließlich persönliche Notizen für mich dazu,
                    \          wie man "korrekt" dieses Skript schreibt, insbesondere wie man die
                    \          automatische Numerierung verwendet. Es ist also natürlich nicht Stoff
                    \          der Vorlesung.

                        \            If you want to add a new chapter, you have to do two things: add an
                        \            entry to

                        \            Just follow the format there. Then add the linked file. Best to
                        \            copy an existing file, a "chapter" or a "subchapter" file, depending
                        \            on the new file you want to create. The ordering in which they
                        \            appear (in the table of content and in the link structure given by
                        \            the

                        \            determined purely by the order in which they appear in

                        \            would have to read the file containing it. So we'd have to write
                        \            code that, while loading Chapter 9, loads all chapters of referenced
                        \            environments. Potentially, this forces the browser to load

                        \            This would take too much time, so we use a precompilation step:
